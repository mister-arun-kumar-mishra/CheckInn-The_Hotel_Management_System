# How to run the CheckInn
### 1: Create the virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv myenv
```
or by
```sh
py -m venv myenv
```
### 2: Activate your environment
```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3: Install the PIP packages/dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4: Setup the database

Run the checkinn.sql script from MySQL workbench or Use the command to do it automatically (from cmd)

```sh
mysql -u your_mysql_username -p your_mysql_password -e "source 'checkinn.sql'"
```
Replace the `your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password` with the your credentials <br>
This will create and set up the database. <br>
###### Note: If you are running checkinn.sql the first time, comment out line no. 68

### 5: Add database credentials to the app
Replace `YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD` and `YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME` in the `.env` file with your credentials

### 6: Installing Fonts
In order to make the app's gui look good, you will have to install the Montserrat font. From the `assets` folder, install all three fonts (with `.ttf` format) by double clicking them.

### 7: It's done ðŸŽ‰ | Run the app
Run the `checkInn.py` file with Python, and you should see the login window if you have followed each step correctly.
```sh
python checkInn.py
```

The default username and password are `username` and `password`, respectively.

#### Adding new users

To add new login credentials, you will have to create new users by directly adding records to the database in the `login` table. Run the command to insert new login credentials:

```sql
INSERT INTO login (username, password) values ("login_username_you_wants", "give_password_for_login");
```
